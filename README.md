# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my journey learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Repository Structure

- **1D Array**: Implementation of one-dimensional array operations and related problems
  - Finding largest elements, array rotation, trapping rain water problem, etc.

- **2D Array**: Two-dimensional array operations and matrix problems
  - Matrix rotation, transpose, spiral traversal, Pascal's triangle, etc.

- **Pattern Printing**: Various pattern printing programs

- **OOPS**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++

- **Recursion**: Recursive algorithm implementations
  - Fibonacci series, Tower of Hanoi, permutations, combinations, etc.

- **Searching**: Various searching algorithms

- **Sorting**: Implementation of sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, etc.

- **String**: String manipulation algorithms

## Purpose

This repository serves as both a personal learning resource and a reference for common DSA problems and their solutions. Each file typically focuses on a specific algorithm or problem, implementing it in C++.
