### Constructor and Destructor in C++

#### **Constructor**:
A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object. The constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

#### **Destructor**:
A **destructor** is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is used to release resources allocated to the object. The destructor has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (`~`), and it does not take any arguments or return a value.

### Types of Constructors

1. **Default Constructor**:
   - A constructor that takes no arguments.
   - It initializes the object with default values.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   class Student {
   public:
       Student() { // Default constructor
           cout << "Default Constructor called!" << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Student s1; // Default constructor is called
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Parameterized Constructor**:
   - A constructor that takes arguments to initialize the object with specific values.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   class Student {
   private:
       string name;
       int roll_no;

   public:
       Student(string n, int r) { // Parameterized constructor
           name = n;
           roll_no = r;
       }

       void display() {
           cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll No: " << roll_no << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Student s1("Alice", 101); // Parameterized constructor is called
       s1.display();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Copy Constructor**:
   - A constructor that initializes an object by copying another object of the same class.

   **Example**:
   ```cpp
   class Student {
   private:
       string name;
       int roll_no;

   public:
       Student(string n, int r) { // Parameterized constructor
           name = n;
           roll_no = r;
       }

       Student(const Student &s) { // Copy constructor
           name = s.name;
           roll_no = s.roll_no;
       }

       void display() {
           cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll No: " << roll_no << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Student s1("Alice", 101); // Parameterized constructor is called
       Student s2 = s1;          // Copy constructor is called
       s2.display();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### Destructor Example

```cpp
class Student {
public:
    Student() {
        cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;
    }

    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1; // Constructor is called
    return 0;   // Destructor is called when the object goes out of scope
}
```

### Summary
- **Constructor**: Initializes an object when it is created.
- **Destructor**: Cleans up resources when an object is destroyed.
- Types of constructors include **default constructor**, **parameterized constructor**, and **copy constructor**.
