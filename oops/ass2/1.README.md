📁 File Streams in C++
File streams in C++ are used to read from or write to files stored on the disk. The file stream classes are provided by the <fstream> header.

🔸 Types of File Stream Classes:
ifstream – Input file stream (for reading from files)

ofstream – Output file stream (for writing to files)

fstream – File stream (for both reading and writing)

🔹 Common Operations:
open() – Opens the file

close() – Closes the file

is_open() – Checks if the file opened successfully

<< – Writes data to a file

>> – Reads data from a file

getline() – Reads a full line from the file

🧵 String Streams in C++
String streams are used to perform input and output operations on strings as if they were streams (like cin/cout). They are defined in the <sstream> header.

🔸 Types of String Stream Classes:
ostringstream – Output string stream (write to string)

istringstream – Input string stream (read from string)

stringstream – Read/write stream on strings

🔹 Common Operations:
<< – Insert data into a string

>> – Extract data from a string

str() – Convert stream to string or set string to stream
