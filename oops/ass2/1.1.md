### Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Object-Oriented Programming

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a mathematical model for data types where the data type is defined by its behavior (operations) rather than its implementation. In object-oriented programming, ADTs are implemented using **classes** and **objects**. ADTs focus on _what_ operations are performed, not _how_ they are implemented.

For example:

- A **Stack** ADT defines operations like `push`, `pop`, and `peek`, but it does not specify how these operations are implemented (e.g., using an array or a linked list).

### Object and Class in Object-Oriented Programming

#### **Class**

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

#### **Object**

An **object** is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with the attributes and behaviors defined by its class.

### Example: Class and Object

```python
# Class definition
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_engine(self):
        return f"The engine of {self.brand} {self.model} is now running."

    def stop_engine(self):
        return f"The engine of {self.brand} {self.model} is now stopped."

# Creating objects (instances of the class)
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022)

# Accessing object attributes and methods
print(car1.start_engine())  # Output: The engine of Toyota Corolla is now running.
print(car2.stop_engine())   # Output: The engine of Honda Civic is now stopped.
```

In this example:

- `Car` is the **class**.
- `car1` and `car2` are **objects** (instances of the `Car` class).
- The methods `start_engine` and `stop_engine` define the behavior of the `Car` class.

This demonstrates how classes and objects work together to implement ADTs in object-oriented programming.
