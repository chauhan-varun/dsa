Exception Handling in C++

Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to deal with unexpected events or errors (referred to as "exceptions") in a controlled way. Instead of letting an error crash the program, exception handling helps to catch the error, handle it, and continue execution, or gracefully terminate the program.

In C++, exception handling is done using the following blocks:

try block: This block contains the code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs within the try block, the program control is transferred to the catch block.

catch block: This block catches the exception thrown by the try block. You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

throw statement: This is used to throw an exception. It can be used to signal that something went wrong during the execution of the code.
