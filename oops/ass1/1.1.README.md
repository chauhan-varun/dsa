Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are two distinct programming paradigms. Here's a comparison:

### **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)**
1. **Focus**: Focuses on functions (procedures) that operate on data.
2. **Structure**: Programs are divided into small parts called functions.
3. **Data Handling**: Data is typically global and shared among functions, making it less secure.
4. **Reusability**: Limited reusability; functions are reused, but data and behavior are not encapsulated.
5. **Approach**: Follows a top-down approach in program design.
6. **Examples**: C, Pascal, Fortran.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
1. **Focus**: Focuses on objects that combine data and behavior (methods).
2. **Structure**: Programs are divided into objects and classes.
3. **Data Handling**: Data is encapsulated within objects, providing better security and abstraction.
4. **Reusability**: High reusability through inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
5. **Approach**: Follows a bottom-up approach in program design.
6. **Examples**: C++, Java, Python.

### **Key Differences**
| Aspect                | POP                          | OOP                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Primary Unit**      | Functions                   | Objects and Classes          |
| **Data Security**     | Less secure (global data)   | More secure (encapsulation)  |
| **Reusability**       | Limited                     | High (inheritance, polymorphism) |
| **Design Approach**   | Top-down                    | Bottom-up                    |
| **Complexity Handling**| Less suited for complex systems | Well-suited for complex systems |

In summary, POP is simpler and suitable for smaller programs, while OOP is more powerful and better suited for large, complex, and scalable applications.
