 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on four primary components: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**. Below is a description of each component with real-world examples:

---

### **1. Encapsulation**
- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, ensuring data security.
- **Real-World Example**: 
  - A **bank account** class encapsulates data like account number, balance, and methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. The balance is private and can only be accessed or modified through these methods.
  
```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance; // Encapsulated data
public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    void withdraw(double amount) { if (amount <= balance) balance -= amount; }
};
```

---

### **2. Inheritance**
- **Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent), promoting code reuse and hierarchy.
- **Real-World Example**: 
  - A **vehicle** class can be a parent class with attributes like `speed` and `fuel`. A **car** class and a **bike** class can inherit these properties and add their own specific features.
  
```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    int speed;
    void move() { /* common functionality */ }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    int numberOfDoors;
    void honk() { /* specific to Car */ }
};
```

---

### **3. Polymorphism**
- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that calls them. It can be achieved through method overloading or overriding.
- **Real-World Example**: 
  - A **shape** class can have a method `draw()`. A **circle** and a **rectangle** class can override this method to provide their specific implementation.
  
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() { /* generic draw */ }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { /* draw a circle */ }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { /* draw a rectangle */ }
};
```

---

### **4. Abstraction**
- **Definition**: Abstraction hides the implementation details and only exposes the essential features of an object.
- **Real-World Example**: 
  - A **coffee machine** provides an interface to make coffee (e.g., `brewCoffee()`), but the user does not need to know the internal workings of the machine.
  
```cpp
class CoffeeMachine {
public:
    virtual void brewCoffee() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class EspressoMachine : public CoffeeMachine {
public:
    void brewCoffee() override { /* specific implementation */ }
};
```

### **Summary Table**

| Component       | Definition                                                                 | Real-World Example         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Encapsulation**| Bundling data and methods into a class, restricting direct access         | Bank account               |
| **Inheritance**  | Reusing properties and behaviors of a parent class in a child class       | Vehicle → Car, Bike        |
| **Polymorphism** | Performing different tasks using the same method name                    | Shape → Circle, Rectangle  |
| **Abstraction**  | Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features        | Coffee machine             |

These components work together to make OOP a powerful paradigm for building modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.
