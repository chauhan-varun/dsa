Method Overloading
Method overloading means having multiple functions with the same name in the same class, but with different parameter lists (either in number or type of parameters). This is an example of compile-time polymorphism, because the function to call is determined at compile time.

Method Overriding
Method overriding occurs when a derived class provides a new implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class, using the same function signature. This is an example of run-time polymorphism, and it typically involves virtual functions.
