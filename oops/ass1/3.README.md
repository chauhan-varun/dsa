✅ Virtual Function in C++
A virtual function is a member function in a base class that you can override in a derived class. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. When you call a virtual function using a base class pointer pointing to a derived class object, the derived class version is executed.

✅ Pure Virtual Function in C++
A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no definition in the base class and is declared by assigning = 0. Any class containing a pure virtual function becomes an abstract class, which means you cannot create objects of that class.
